# Explain-detectScene

detectScene(image: CIImage) is a function that takes in an image as a parameter. While the work of the image detection is occurring, the screen displays a message reading “detecting scene…” and an activity indicator so that the user knows that something is happening. Within detectScene, we load the VGG16 model (which is the same one I used in my MachineLearningVision challenge) and exit the function if the model does not load properly. We request the model for image detection results with a completion handler and set the results as [VNClassificationObservation] objects. In an asynchronous call, we ask the activityIndicator to stop spinning when it is finished detecting, and the results of the image detection by the model are displayed as percentages on the UI screen. The last piece of the detectScene function runs the CoreML GoogLeNetPlaces classifier on the image, allowing you to use a different model to detect the image.
